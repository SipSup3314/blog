    <h2>Making a case for my Raspberry Pi</h2>

      <h3>The Idea</h3>
      <p>
        I have a Raspberry Pi which I use for retro gaming and web servers. If
        you don't know what an Raspberry Pi is, it's a credit card-sized
        computer that's used for hobby projects. I've been wanting to make a
        casing/shell for it because I like customizing my things. I came up with
        a bunch of styles such as a flat slab and a spherical design, but I
        eventually settled on a hilarious pun: the Leaning Tower of Pi-sa. Get
        it? Pisa but with a Raspberry <i>Pi?</i> *laughs in html/css* Well, I
        thought it was funny. The case would look like a PC tower, but leaning
        backwards, hence the name. Below is the original design (and yes I made a blueprint).<br /><br /><img src="1.JPG" alt="pi-blueprint"><br><br>To be continued... mainly because I ran out of time writing this.
